# 🐍 Python Learning Roadmap (Beginner to Extreme)

This is my personal Python mastery journey — from writing "Hello, World" to building extreme-level systems. Inspired by real-world applications, deep concepts, and open-source mastery.

## ✅ Month 1: Beginner Level — *The Foundation*
- [ ] Python installed & working with VSCode or Jupyter
- [ ] Basic syntax: variables, data types
- [ ] Conditionals (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- [ ] Loops (`for`, `while`)
- [ ] Functions and scope
- [ ] Strings and string formatting
- [ ] Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries
- [ ] File I/O (reading and writing text files)
- [ ] Mini Projects:
  - [ ] Calculator
  - [ ] Word Counter
  - [ ] To-Do List (CLI)

...

## Final Goal:
> Be able to think, build, and debug in Python like a pro — using it as a tool to **create**, **automate**, and **innovate**.
